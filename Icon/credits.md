The iso icon, the mdf icon and the return arrow icon are works by [Freepik](http://www.freepik.com/) from [www.flaticon.com](http://www.flaticon.com/).

The cdi icon was edited together using the mdf icon as a base to change its writing.
For that writing, the Open Font [Ek Mukta](https://ektype.in/mukta.html) was used.

The app icon was then edited together using the icons from Freepik and the cdi icon.
